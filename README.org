#+TITLE: MSYS Portable
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler
* Introduction
Msys is a minimal unix system.  This uses [[http://portableapps.com/node/18601][MinGW Portable]], and is
initally based on MSYS Portable found [[http://portableapps.com/node/30163][here]].  It has the following
differences:

- MSYS is assumed to be in the MinGW directory, that way mingw-get
  will work.
- The fstab will be replaced with the current drive letter
- If not available, MSYS will install from MinGW.
